## Defining relationships in SDL

GraphQL types can reference other types. When defining your schema, use the `@relation` GraphQL schema directive on the fields that reference other types. For example:

```graphql
type Movie {
  title: String
  year: Int
  genres: [Attribute] @relation(name: "IN_GENRE", direction: "OUT")
}

type Genre {
  name: String
  movies: [Movie] @relation(name: "IN_GENRE", direction: "IN")
}
```

## Relationships with properties

The above example (annotating a field with `@relation`) works for simple relationships without properties, but does not allow for modeling relationship properties. Imagine that we have users who can rate movies, and we want to store their rating and timestamp as a property on a relationship connecting the user and movie. We can represent this by promoting the relationship to a type and moving the `@relation` directive to annotate this new type:

```graphql
type Movie {
  title: String
  year: Int
  ratings: [Rated]
}

type User {
  userId: ID
  name: String
  rated: [Rated]
}

type Rated @relation(name: "RATED") {
  from: User
  to: Movie
  rating: Float
  timestamp: Int
}
```

This approach of an optional relationship type allows for keeping the schema simple when we don't need relationship properties, but having the flexibility of handling relationship properties when we want to model them.

## Relationship queries

When queries are generated (through [`augmentSchema`](neo4j-graphql-js-api.mdx#augmentschemaschema-graphqlschema) or [`makeAugmentedSchema`](neo4j-graphql-js-api.mdx#makeaugmentedschemaoptions-graphqlschema)) fields referencing a relationship type are replaced with a special payload type that contains the relationship properties and the type reference. For example:

```graphql
type _MovieRatings {
  timestamp: Int
  rating: Float
  User: User
}
```

## Relationship mutations

See the [generated mutations](graphql-schema-generation-augmentation.mdx#generated-mutations) section for information on the mutations generated for relationship types.
