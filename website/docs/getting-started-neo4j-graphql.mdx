_Build full stack graph applications with ease._

## Installation

The easiest way to get started with GRANDstack is to use the [GRANDstack starter](getting-started-grand-stack-starter.mdx).

## What is GRANDstack?

GRANDstack is a combination of technologies that work together to enable developers to build data intensive full stack applications. The components of GRANDstack are:

- [**GraphQL**](https://graphql.org/) - A new paradigm for building APIs, GraphQL is a way of describing data and enabling clients to query it.
- [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building component based reusable user interfaces.
- [**Apollo**](https://www.apollographql.com/) - A suite of tools that work together to create great GraphQL workflows.
- [**Neo4j Database**](https://neo4j.com/developer/) - The native graph database that allows you to model, store, and query your data the same way you think about it: as a graph.

Here's how it all fits together in the context of a movie search app:
