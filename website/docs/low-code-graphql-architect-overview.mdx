## Low Code GraphQL With GraphQL Architect

The goal of GraphQL Architect is to simplify the process of developing, querying, and deploying GraphQL APIs.

Features:

* Query local or remote GraphQL APIs using GraphiQL.
* Generate and run a local GraphQL API from an existing Neo4j Database, without writing any code. The schema will be inferred from the database’s data model.
* Alternatively, drive your Neo4j database’s property graph model by defining its GraphQL schema using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL).
* Add custom logic by adding Cypher statements to your GraphQL schema using the @cypher GraphQL schema directive.
* Edit the GraphQL schema using a schema-aware GraphQL type definition editor with linting and semantic auto-complete suggestions.
* Export and deploy your GraphQL API application.

With GraphQL Architect you can build, query, and deploy GraphQL APIs backed by Neo4j using just GraphQL SDL — no code is necessary. Custom logic can be added to your API using the Cypher query language.
